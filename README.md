# AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Portfolio (IIT Kanpur)

This repository contains the **complete codebase**, **mathematical implementations**, and **project modules** developed during the **IIT Kanpur Professional Certificate Program** in Python for AI, ML, and Deep Learning.

Instructor: Aditya K. Jagannatham

The focus of this repository is on the **rigorous application** of Python-based libraries to solve complex data problems, moving from fundamental **Linear Algebra** to advanced **Deep Learning** architectures.

## Core Technical Modules
The codebase is organized into the following theoretical and practical pillars:

* **Mathematical Foundations:** Implementation of **Linear Algebra**, **Probability**, and **Optimization** techniques using **NumPy** and **SciPy**.
* **Classic Machine Learning:** **Regression** (Linear/Logistic), **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Dimensionality Reduction** (LDA/PCA).
* **Deep Learning Frameworks:** Building and training **Neural Networks** using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **Theano**.
* **Computer Vision:** Image processing and classification using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.
